In turn, PVC plastic guarantees optimal thermal and sound insulation as well as high functionality. KÖMMERLING 76 offers a unique combination of the advantages of aluminium and PVC plastic in the form of innovative Alu Clip, Alu Clip Pro and AddOn systems.

The innovative AS 75P system allows for the production of thermally insulated doors with a panel glued on the entire surface of the leaf. This type of solution looks great in modern construction. Additional advantages of our aluminium panel doors include solid workmanship, durability, and a wide variety of designs of door fillings (panels).",

      "p1": "The doors are built on a stable standard-width or wider window frame and are intended for apartments in blocks of flats and exits to balconies in houses where it is not possible or necessary to enter from the outside. A modification of this solution is the use of a low aluminium threshold, which does not constitute a barrier for children, wheelchairs, etc.The handle is only mounted from the inside. Some practical additions to these balcony doors include a mini-pull with a latch and a brake in the handle. The first allows you to close the door from the outside, and the other – to lock it in a specific opening position.An intermediate solution between a balcony door and a terrace (entrance) door is a balcony door on a wide leaf with a handle on each side and a lock.",
      "p2": "The glazing units for balcony and terrace doors are designed to achieve the highest possible strength. For this purpose, the following are most often used:– toughened glass – SECURIT, which is five times stronger than ordinary glass and, if broken, breaks into many small pieces with unsharp edges.",
      "p3": "– or glued glass – STANDIP, with one or more layers of PVB foil, which, in case of breakage, keeps the glass fragments in place.",
      "p4": "With the use of this type of glazing units, the resistance of balcony and terrace doors to various external forces is significantly increased.",
      "p5": "Terrace doors are a type of doors similar to entrance doors (low threshold, solid Dr. Hahn hinges, a three-point latch locked with a handle, the possibility of using a second lock and safe locking elements and, most importantly, two types of opening: to the inside as a balcony door or to the outside as an entrance door)."

With this system, it is possible to build large movable terrace glazing with a low and warm threshold. Its construction mechanisms enable safe and comfortable sliding of heavy leaves, manually or automatically. The use of fittings from reputable suppliers allows for comfortable sliding of even very heavy leaves.",
      "p2": "The AS 178HS system works well in buildings with large glazing, restaurants, or winter gardens, where key features include the ease of movement from inside the room to the outside, ease of use, design and aesthetics. An important advantage of this solution is the fact that it does not occupy the space of the interior and fits well in any arrangement. The innovative structure allows for the highest parameters of thermal insulation.",
      "p3": "In the AS 178HS system, it is possible to completely enclose the frame in the insulation layer, which allows to emphasise the decorative qualities of the façade and gives the building an individual and unique character. The structure can be made in all development schemes available on the market (a solution with two or three tracks, a solution with the possibility of using fixed glazing in passive leaves, etc.)"

Its main features are small width and tapering shape. It rolls up perfectly and fits to even small boxes. Thanks to the foam filling the profile inside, it is well insulated in terms of temperatures and noise. Small weight allows for manual drive, spring drive or electric operation. PA 39 is offered as a perforated version or plain in wide range of colours similar to RAL palette. The profiles are durable in terms of colour and resistance to wear-off. The profile is also resistant to the impact of atmospheric conditions.<br></br>Aluminium profiles belong to products which are ecologically clean. The foam inside is free of freon compounds and the paints do not contain cadmium."

In such a case, it is required to prove the accordance with the examples included in Appendix 2 of the DIN4108 standard.
