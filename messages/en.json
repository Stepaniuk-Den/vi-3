The use of the innovative TWIN system allows the frame with double (AS series) or triple (MD series) sealing to be easily fitted to the window sash. In addition, this new twin system uses the world’s first EPDM heat seal. Schüco, thanks to cooperation with Semperit, has exclusive rights to this type of sealing technology. It is due to the use of flexible and heat-sealable material that the tightness in windows and doors has increased significantly, especially in problematic corner areas.",

      "p1": "The doors are made of high-impact, deformation-resistant PVC from the renowned company Schüco. Good thermal insulation is ensured by multi-chamber profiles, while steel reinforcements of a large size and optimal thickness contribute to the stiffness and stability of the product.",
      "p2": "The structure of the profiles gives us the possibility of installing multi-point locks and reinforced locking elements. This type of solution ensures we obtain safe doors with a long service life. Our exterior doors made of PVC have a low aluminium threshold with a thermal break.",
      "p3": "The door leaf filling consists of two sandwich panels made of plastic, separated by polyurethane foam, which ensures very good thermal insulation of the door. Door panels can be enriched with various types of glass and ornamental frames. The surface layer of PVC panels is covered with high-quality acrylic films or varnishes, resistant to weather conditions and UV rays. In addition to the models of door fillings presented in our galleries, we are happy to make doors according to your individual project."

Some practical additions to these balcony doors include a mini-pull with a latch and a brake in the handle. The first allows you to close the door from the outside, and the other – to lock it in a specific opening position.An intermediate solution between a balcony door and a terrace (entrance) door is a balcony door on a wide leaf with a handle on each side and a lock."
