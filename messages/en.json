The use of the innovative TWIN system allows the frame with double (AS series) or triple (MD series) sealing to be easily fitted to the window sash. In addition, this new twin system uses the world’s first EPDM heat seal. Schüco, thanks to cooperation with Semperit, has exclusive rights to this type of sealing technology. It is due to the use of flexible and heat-sealable material that the tightness in windows and doors has increased significantly, especially in problematic corner areas.",

      "p1": "The doors are built on a stable standard-width or wider window frame and are intended for apartments in blocks of flats and exits to balconies in houses where it is not possible or necessary to enter from the outside. A modification of this solution is the use of a low aluminium threshold, which does not constitute a barrier for children, wheelchairs, etc.The handle is only mounted from the inside. Some practical additions to these balcony doors include a mini-pull with a latch and a brake in the handle. The first allows you to close the door from the outside, and the other – to lock it in a specific opening position.An intermediate solution between a balcony door and a terrace (entrance) door is a balcony door on a wide leaf with a handle on each side and a lock.",
      "p2": "The glazing units for balcony and terrace doors are designed to achieve the highest possible strength. For this purpose, the following are most often used:– toughened glass – SECURIT, which is five times stronger than ordinary glass and, if broken, breaks into many small pieces with unsharp edges.",
      "p3": "– or glued glass – STANDIP, with one or more layers of PVB foil, which, in case of breakage, keeps the glass fragments in place.",
      "p4": "With the use of this type of glazing units, the resistance of balcony and terrace doors to various external forces is significantly increased.",
      "p5": "Terrace doors are a type of doors similar to entrance doors (low threshold, solid Dr. Hahn hinges, a three-point latch locked with a handle, the possibility of using a second lock and safe locking elements and, most importantly, two types of opening: to the inside as a balcony door or to the outside as an entrance door)."
